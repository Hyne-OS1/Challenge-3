# Challenge-3



## Description

* My motivation for this project was to create a functional javascript password generator that allows users to create a random password and allow it to generate depending on what characters they select.

* My contrusction of this project was to create a functional website that used 3 coding languages in order to create a random passwrod generator, HTML, CSS and javascript, javascript being the primary focus.

* Creating a user friendly code base that is both structured equally across all 3 languages aswell as being clearly labelled makes for a more coherent experience for both the user and the developer.

* Taking on this project gave me a much better understanding on the processes of javascript and how they interact with other languages. Broadening my understanding of javascript and undertaking this code myself has shown me how to structure my code properly and how each function should present itself in a working environment. This project will be a useful reference point for many future challenges.

## Usage

Using this website is very simple and straight forward for all users. Simply click the "generate password" button on the screen to begin generating your new random secure password ensuring to at least meet one of the character criterias. Inspecting the page will show you javascript formatting aswell as the accompanying css and html code.
